# C Stew’s Skyrim SE Modlist v1.0 [WIP]
## Foreword:
This modlist uses the **now outdated 1.5.97 version** of Skyrim SE. If you have updated to or are using the Anniversary Edition, use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618) to downgrade to the compatible SE version. It is also incompatible with Skyrim: Legendary Edition, the original game with all DLC Add-ons, and Skyrim VR, the Virtual Reality version of Skyrim SE, due to many mods not supporting those versions of the game.

This modlist uses ESO & UI’s [SKYRIM SE MICRO MOD LIST – V1.2](https://eso-ui.com/skyrim-se-micro-list/) as a base. Links to these mods will be included here, but you can skip the *ESO & UI’s List* section if you choose to install them according to their website. Either way, you will get the same result.

*I have yet to test the full pack, so I am currently unable to vouch for the performance at this time.*

This guide is designed to be as user-friendly as possible and accessible to those with zero previous modding experience!
