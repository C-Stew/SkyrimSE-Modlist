# C Stew’s Skyrim SE Mod List v1.0 [WIP]
## Foreword:
This mod list uses the **now outdated 1.5.97 version** of Skyrim SE. If you have updated to or are using the Anniversary Edition, use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618) to downgrade to the compatible SE version. It is also incompatible with Skyrim: Legendary Edition, the original game with all DLC Add-ons, and Skyrim VR, the Virtual Reality version of Skyrim SE, due to many mods not supporting those versions of the game.

This mod list uses ESO & UI’s [SKYRIM SE MICRO MOD LIST – V1.2](https://eso-ui.com/skyrim-se-micro-list/) as a base. Links to these mods will be included here, but you can skip the *ESO & UI’s List* section if you choose to install them according to their website. Either way, you will get the same result.

*I have yet to test the full pack, so I am currently unable to vouch for the performance at this time.*

This guide is designed to be as user-friendly as possible and accessible to those with zero previous modding experience!

## Pre-Installation
I will be using [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) to install and manage mods. For a comprehensive usage and setup guide, Ultimate Immersion has an intuitive video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyDtcYuDd9w) on setting up your Skyrim installation and Vortex to be mod-ready. **It also covers installing SKSE64, a crucial plugin that requires manual installation. Make sure you download *Legacy SE build 2.0.20 (runtime 1.5.97)*, NOT the *Latest AE Build!***

When downloading mods, use the **MOD MANAGER DOWNLOAD** button unless otherwise specified. Do note that Nexus limits Non-premium users to one 1MB/s download at a time, so patience is a must. If you get a pop-up in your browser asking to open a link with Vortex, **select Allow**. It will automatically begin downloading the mod within Vortex.

If Vortex shows any mod conflicts in the upper right corner, **always load the mods in the order of this list**. Mods downloaded first should be loaded **before** mods downloaded after them. This way features won’t be unintentionally overridden by other mods.
